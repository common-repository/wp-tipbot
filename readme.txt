== Description ==

As content author youâ€™re spending hours and days creating great blog articles and pages for the community. And you have the right to ask for a tip. Even the smallest tip will count but whet it comes to transactions and bank taxes things get ugly. But not in the world of the blockchain and the cryptocurrency.

And now we have have created an easy way for you to integrate the XRP Tip Bot in WordPress as a widget in your sidebar or as shortcode on any page you would like.

This plugin will give you the option to creat a XRP tip button with your own settings like ammount of the tip, and thank you message.

A settings page has been added in version 1.1.0 where you can set the default values for your shortcode. Also saving the 'network' and 'receiver' values will open a new tab for your with the related balance for the selected account (see img.5).
